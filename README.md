# B-Space Cosmology

**A mechanical alternative to Lambda-CDM that resolves the Hubble tension and galaxy spin anomalies without dark energy.**

## Overview

This repository contains the complete theoretical framework, supplementary materials, and analysis code for B-Space Cosmology. The model proposes that the observable universe is a finite, rotating system expanding into a static Euclidean background. Its dynamics are governed by classical mechanics—pressure, rotation, and dissipative drag—providing a first-principles solution to several major tensions in the standard cosmological model (\(\Lambda\)CDM).

The core scientific paper is being prepared for submission to the arXiv preprint server (`astro-ph.CO`). A link will be provided here upon its announcement.

## Repository Structure

*   **/paper**: Contains the main scientific paper and all supplementary documents in their final, cross-referenced form. The `submission.tex` file can be compiled to generate the complete work.
*   **/code**: Contains the Python/Cobaya pipelines used for MCMC analysis and for generating the model's theoretical predictions.
*   **/docs**: Contains the individual working documents, drafts, and conceptual primers used in the development of the theory.

## Key Documents
