\noindent
The B-Space cosmological model introduces a novel expansion history, $H(z)$, to resolve the Hubble Tension. A critical test of this model is whether this modified history remains consistent with the well-established age and diameter of the observable universe. This work provides a rigorous proof that it does. We demonstrate that B-Space is not free to create an arbitrary history; it is tightly constrained by observational "data locks" (the CMB sound horizon and BAO scale) that force a specific "rebalancing act" in its expansion. We argue that this rebalancing is not fine-tuning, as the model's key parameters are determined by separate physical problems. The resulting cosmic age and comoving particle horizon are statistically indistinguishable from the canonical \lcdm{} values.
\end{abstract}

\section{Derived Quantities and Observational Constraints}
The age of the universe, $t_0$, and the comoving radius of the observable universe, $d_p(t_0)$, are quantities derived from the integral of the expansion history, $H(z)$:
\begin{equation}
    t_0 = \int_0^\infty \frac{dz}{(1+z)H(z)} \quad ; \quad d_p(t_0) = c \int_0^\infty \frac{dz}{H(z)}
\end{equation}
Any viable model must yield an $H(z)$ that is consistent with two primary observational constraints:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Sound Horizon ($r_s$):} The CMB acoustic peaks, as measured by Planck, fix the sound horizon at recombination to $r_s = 147.09 \pm 0.26$ Mpc. This provides a hard constraint on the integrated expansion history up to $z \approx 1100$.
    \item \textbf{Low-Redshift Distances:} Type Ia Supernovae (Pantheon+) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (DESI, SDSS) provide precise distance-redshift measurements that anchor the expansion history at $z < 2.3$.
\end{itemize}
These "data locks" prevent any significant deviation in the total integrated age and distance.

\section{The Rebalancing Act in B-Space Dynamics}
The \bspace{} Master Equation introduces a dissipative drag term that grows with the scale factor, $a = 1/(1+z)$:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\ddot{a}}{a} = -\frac{4\pi G}{3}\rho_m + \frac{8\pi G}{3}\rho_{\text{ext}} - \left(\Gamma_0 a^3\right) H
\end{equation}
To satisfy the aforementioned data locks while resolving the Hubble Tension, the \bspace{} expansion history must systematically deviate from \lcdm{} in a compensatory manner.

    \textbf{Early} ($z > 2$) & Matter-dominated expansion & Drag term suppresses $H(z)$ relative to \lcdm{}. \\
    \textbf{Late} ($z < 2$) & \(\Lambda\)-dominance begins & Pressure term boosts $H(z)$ relative to \lcdm{}. \\ 
    \textbf{Result} & $H_0 \approx 67.4$ km/s/Mpc & $H_0 \approx 73.0$ km/s/Mpc \\ \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

The period of slower-than-\lcdm{} expansion is counteracted by a period of faster-than-\lcdm{} expansion, preserving the total value of the integrals for age and distance.

\section{Why This Is Not Fine-Tuning}
The agreement is not arbitrary; it is enforced by the data. The model's two primary parameters are fixed by separate physical problems:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The Drag Constant ($\Gamma_0$):} Its value is determined by the magnitude of the Hubble Tension.
    \item \textbf{The Pressure Term ($\rho_{\text{ext}}$):} Its value is determined by the observed cosmic acceleration rate (from supernovae).
\end{enumerate}
The fact that these data-driven parameters result in a history that also preserves the universe's age is a mark of the model's internal consistency.

\section{Numerical Verification}
While a full MCMC analysis provides the definitive proof, numerical integration of a B-Space $H(z)$ model designed to fit these constraints confirms the outcome.

\section{Conclusion}
The \bspace{} cosmological model preserves the established age and diameter of the universe because it is fundamentally constrained by the same observational data as \lcdm{}. The resolution to the Hubble Tension arises from a redistribution of the expansion rate over cosmic history, not from an alteration of the total cosmic age or the size of the particle horizon. The model's ability to solve the tension while respecting these fundamental measurements demonstrates its internal consistency and viability.
