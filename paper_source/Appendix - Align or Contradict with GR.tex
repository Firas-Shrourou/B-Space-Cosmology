\section{Alignment with GR: Core Principles}

\subsection{Einstein’s Equations Hold}
General Relativity (GR) governs the drip’s interior dynamics:
\begin{equation}
    G_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{No \(\Lambda\):} The accelerative effect of dark energy is replaced by the mechanical work done by the B-Space background pressure (\(\Delta P\)).
    \item \textbf{Drag:} The dissipative drag force is included in the stress-energy tensor \(T_{\mu\nu}\) as a standard viscous fluid term:
    \begin{equation}
        T_{\mu\nu}^{\text{drag}} = -\zeta \theta h_{\mu\nu}, \quad \text{where the effective viscosity } \zeta \text{ is related to } (\Gamma_0 a^3).
    \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Equivalence Principle Intact}
The equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass is preserved. Test particles follow geodesics within the Drip, as GR remains the local theory of gravity.

\subsection{Weak-Field Consistency}
All standard Solar System tests of GR (e.g., gravitational lensing, the perihelion precession of Mercury) are unaffected, as they occur deep within the Drip's potential well where local GR dynamics dominate completely over cosmological forces.

\section{Reinterpreting Expansion}

\subsection{Expansion as Motion, Not Metric Stretching}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{\lcdm{}} & \textbf{\bspace{}} \\
\midrule
Space itself expands (metric evolves) & The \drip{} moves through a static \bspace{} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{GR Permits Embedding:} An FLRW metric for the Drip's interior can be embedded in a higher-dimensional static Euclidean space (e.g., the Milne model).
    \item \textbf{Key Difference:} \bspace{} is postulated to be a \textit{physical} background, not merely a mathematical abstraction.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Preferred Frame Controversy}
\bspace{} defines a cosmic rest frame, which violates global Lorentz invariance. However:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Saving GR:} This frame is unobservable from within the Drip (analogous to the CMB rest frame). Local physics remains Lorentz invariant, preserving the core of GR in all testable local experiments.
\end{itemize}

% --- REVISED SECTION ---
\subsection{Primordial Vorticity}
Unlike \lcdm{}, \bspace{} allows for a non-zero primordial vorticity field (PVF), which is a relic "texture" in the B-Space medium itself. This field provides the initial angular momentum for galaxy formation.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{GR Allows This:} While large-scale rotation is tightly constrained, local vorticity and anisotropic cosmologies are valid solutions within GR (e.g., Bianchi models). The PVF is a specific physical realization of this possibility.
\end{itemize}

\section{Resolving Common Criticisms}

\subsection{“Where’s the Boundary?”}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[\textbf{Criticism:}] Boundaries break the diffeomorphism invariance central to GR.
    \item[\textbf{Reply:}] The B-Space background is non-gravitational. The Drip’s edge is a fluid interface, not a spacetime junction requiring a thin-shell formalism. The forces (\(\Delta P\), drag) act volumetrically on the Drip's contents.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{“Drag Violates GR!”}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[\textbf{Criticism:}] Dissipation is absent in the vacuum Einstein equations.
    \item[\textbf{Reply:}] The vacuum equations do not apply to the Drip, which is a fluid. Drag is a standard component of a viscous fluid's stress-energy tensor ($T_{\mu\nu}$) and does not violate GR.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{“Vorticity Conflicts with CMB Isotropy!”}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[\textbf{Criticism:}] Planck data tightly constrains any global rotation of the universe.
    \item[\textbf{Reply:}] This is correct, and it is why the B-Space model does \textit{not} rely on a global rotation of the Drip. The Primordial Vorticity Field (PVF) imparts local vorticity for galaxy formation without requiring a global angular momentum that would violate CMB isotropy constraints.
\end{itemize}

\section{\bspace{} as a GR Extension}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Embedding without Junctions:}
    \begin{quote}
        ``The Drip is an FLRW fluid embedded in \bspace{}—a fixed Euclidean background. GR holds strictly within the Drip; \bspace{} provides mechanical forces, not additional spacetime curvature.''
    \end{quote}
    \item \textbf{Gauge Freedom:}
    \begin{quote}
        ``Choosing 'static coordinates' for the background is a valid physical choice, analogous to using Newtonian or synchronous gauges in standard cosmology.''
    \end{quote}
\end{itemize}

\hrule
\vspace{1em}
\noindent \textbf{Final Note:} \bspace{} is falsifiable entirely within the established framework of physics. It requires no new quantum gravity, extra dimensions, or string theory to be tested.
