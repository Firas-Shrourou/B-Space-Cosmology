\begin{abstract}
\noindent
A valid physical theory must be free from circular reasoning, where a conclusion is derived from premises that implicitly assume the conclusion itself. This paper provides a forensic examination of the B-Space Cosmological framework to verify its logical soundness. We demonstrate that the model is not circular. Its three primary new parameters ($\rho_{\text{ext}}$, $\Gamma_0$, and $z_c$) are not fine-tuned to create a self-supporting loop; rather, each one is independently constrained by a distinct, major observational problem in modern cosmology. This decoupling provides a robust and falsifiable foundation for the theory.

\section{The Core Thesis: A Triad of Independent Constraints}
The B-Space model's claims are ambitious, proposing a unified origin for several cosmological anomalies. The argument against circularity rests on a simple but powerful fact: the model's key parameters are measured by different physical phenomena, using different datasets. A successful fit requires satisfying three separate observational targets simultaneously.

The relationship between the model's core parameters and the data that constrains them is summarized in Table \ref{tab:independence}.

\section{Avoiding the Fallacy of Interdependence}
A skeptic might argue that these parameters are not truly independent, as a change in one (e.g., $\Gamma_0$) will affect the expansion history $H(z)$, which in turn could affect the distance measurements used to constrain the others.

This is correct; the parameters are physically \textbf{coupled}, but they are not \textbf{logically circular}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Coupling vs. Circularity:} Coupling is a feature of any self-consistent physical system. The crucial distinction is that the \textit{primary constraining power} for each parameter comes from a different physical regime and dataset.
    \item \textbf{The Role of MCMC Analysis:} This is precisely the problem a full Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis is designed to solve. The MCMC explores the entire parameter space to find the unique set of values for ($\rho_{\text{ext}}$, $\Gamma_0$, $z_c$) that \textit{simultaneously} provides the best fit to \textit{all} datasets. It finds the single point of mutual consistency.
\end{itemize}
The model is not tuned to solve each problem individually. It proposes a single, unified physics, and we ask the full suite of modern cosmological data if a consistent solution exists.

\section{Conclusion: A Falsifiable, Non-Circular Framework}
B-Space Cosmology avoids circular reasoning by anchoring its core tenets in independent observational challenges.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The cosmic acceleration, measured by supernovae, fixes the \textbf{Pressure}.
    \item The Hubble Tension, measured by Planck vs. SH0ES, fixes the \textbf{Drag}.
    \item The galaxy spin alignment, measured by JWST, fixes the \textbf{Vorticity Field}.
\end{enumerate}
The theory does not use the existence of the Hubble Tension to prove the existence of drag, and then use drag to prove the existence of the tension. Instead, it makes a stronger claim: that the same drag constant required to solve the Hubble Tension must \textit{also} produce specific thermodynamic effects (as detailed in our companion papers).

This web of interlocking but independently constrained predictions ensures that the B-Space framework is a robust, mathematically sound, and highly falsifiable scientific theory.
