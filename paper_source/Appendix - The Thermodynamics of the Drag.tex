\begin{abstract}
\noindent
The B-Space cosmological model resolves the Hubble Tension via a dissipative drag force. The First Law of Thermodynamics dictates that the energy removed by this drag must be converted into heat. This paper provides a complete framework for this process. First, we provide a rigorous mathematical proof of energy conservation, demonstrating that our universe (the "Drip") is an open system exchanging energy with the external B-Space background. Second, we address the critical question, "Where is this heat?" We show that the dissipated energy manifests in three distinct, measurable channels: the anomalous heating of the intergalactic medium (IGM), a non-adiabatic temperature history for the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), and a novel, diffuse component of the Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB). These are not independent phenomena but linked consequences of a single drag constant, $\Gamma_0$, whose value is measured by the Hubble Tension, making the entire framework a highly predictive and falsifiable system.
\end{abstract}

\section{The Foundation of Drag and Energy Exchange}

\subsection{Physical Principles}
The B-Space drag mechanism is built on two core principles:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Origin of Drag:} Friction is a ``particle-to-container'' interaction between the Drip's baryonic matter and the external, static B-Space fabric.
    \item \textbf{Evolution of Drag:} The total drag force grows as the Drip expands. We model this as a volumetric drag, with an effective drag coefficient proportional to the scale factor cubed ($a^3$).
\end{enumerate}
This formulation leads to the B-Space Master Equation for cosmic acceleration:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\ddot{a}}{a} = -\frac{4\pi G}{3}\rho_m + \frac{8\pi G}{3}\rho_{\text{ext}} - \left(\Gamma_0 a^3\right) H
    \label{eq:master}
\end{equation}
The term $(\Gamma_0 a^3)$ is negligible at high redshift ($a \to 0$), preserving BBN and CMB physics, but becomes significant at low redshift, allowing it to resolve the Hubble Tension \citep{Riess2022, Planck2020}.

\subsection{The Thermodynamic Imperative}
The drag term in Equation \ref{eq:master} implies a continuous dissipation of the Drip's kinetic energy. This energy cannot be destroyed. It must be converted into heat, thermalizing the Drip's baryonic constituents. The central question of this paper is how this dissipated energy manifests across the electromagnetic spectrum.

\section{Proof of Energy Conservation}
To demonstrate the model's thermodynamic consistency, we prove that energy is conserved within the global Drip + B-Space system.

\subsection{The Drip as an Open System}
The Drip is an open thermodynamic system that exchanges energy with its environment (B-Space) via two channels:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Energy Input:} Work done by the B-Space pressure ($\Delta P$) on the expanding Drip boundary.
    \item \textbf{Energy Output:} Kinetic energy dissipated into heat by the drag force.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Energy Balance Equation}
The rate of change of the Drip's total internal energy ($E_{\text{total}}$) is the sum of the work done on it and the heat dissipated within it. We can derive this from the Master Equation. The total mechanical energy is $E_{\text{mech}} = \frac{1}{2}M\dot{R}^2 - GM^2/R$. Its rate of change is:
\begin{equation}
    \dot{E}_{\text{mech}} = M\dot{R}\ddot{R} + \frac{GM^2\dot{R}}{R^2}
\end{equation}
Substituting $\ddot{R}$ from the radial form of Equation \ref{eq:master} yields:
\begin{equation}
    \dot{E}_{\text{mech}} = M\dot{R}\left(-\frac{GM}{R^2} + \frac{3\Delta P}{\rho_m R} - (\Gamma_0 a^3)\dot{R}\right) + \frac{GM^2\dot{R}}{R^2}
\end{equation}
The gravitational terms cancel. The pressure term simplifies to $\Delta P (4\pi R^2 \dot{R}) = \Delta P \frac{dV}{dt}$. This gives the final energy balance for the Drip's total energy (mechanical + thermal):
\begin{equation}
    \dot{E}_{\text{total}} = \underbrace{\Delta P \frac{dV}{dt}}_{\text{Work Done ON Drip}} \underbrace{- (\Gamma_0 a^3) M \dot{R}^2}_{\text{Energy Lost TO Heat}}
    \label{eq:balance_final}
\end{equation}
This proves that the change in the Drip's energy is precisely accounted for by the work done by B-Space and the energy dissipated by drag. The total energy of the Universe ($E_{\text{Drip}} + E_{\text{B-Space}}$) is conserved.

\section{Observational Channels for the Dissipated Heat}
The energy dissipated in Equation \ref{eq:balance_final} is not a mathematical abstraction; it is real heat that must be observable. We propose three primary, interlocking channels for its appearance.

\subsection{Channel 1: Anomalous IGM Heating}
\textbf{Hypothesis:} The most direct consequence of volumetric drag is the frictional heating of the Intergalactic Medium (IGM).

\textbf{Observational Context:} A known puzzle is the state of the low-redshift Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, where the IGM appears hotter than can be explained by standard astrophysical heating \citep{McQuinn2016}. B-Space provides a natural, built-in solution: the IGM, as part of the Drip, is directly heated by drag.

\subsection{Channel 2: Non-Adiabatic CMB Evolution}
\textbf{Hypothesis:} The drag-heated IGM will inevitably transfer energy to CMB photons, adding a non-adiabatic component to the CMB's temperature history.

\textbf{Observational Tests:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Direct Temperature Measurement:} A deviation from the rigid $T(z) = T_0(1+z)$ law. A full MCMC analysis is required to determine the precise value of this temperature excess ($\Delta T > 0$), but it remains a sharp, falsifiable prediction testable with ALMA.
    \item \textbf{CMB Spectral Distortions:} Continuous energy injection will create characteristic `y-type` and `Î¼-type` distortions in the CMB's blackbody spectrum, a key target for future missions like PIXIE \citep{Chluba2012}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Channel 3: A Diffuse Infrared Glow}
\textbf{Hypothesis:} The heated IGM radiates its excess energy, which, once redshifted, appears today as a faint, diffuse component of the Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB).

\textbf{Observational Test:} This model predicts a third component of the CIB: a faint, smooth, almost perfectly isotropic glow that is \textbf{uncorrelated} with the distribution of galaxies. This can be tested by cross-correlating CIB maps with galaxy surveys.

\section{Conclusion}
The dissipative drag mechanism in B-Space Cosmology is the linchpin of a predictive thermodynamic framework. This paper has provided the mathematical proof that the model adheres to energy conservation by treating the universe as an open system. The energy dissipated to solve the Hubble Tension is not lost; it is accounted for across the electromagnetic spectrum: in the anomalously hot gas of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, in the non-adiabatic temperature history of the CMB, and as a novel, diffuse component in the CIB. Crucially, all three of these effects are governed by the same drag constant, $\Gamma_0$. This rigid, interlocking set of predictions makes the B-Space model a complete and highly falsifiable theory.
