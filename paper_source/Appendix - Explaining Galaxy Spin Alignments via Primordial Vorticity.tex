\begin{abstract}
The recent discovery by JWST of large-scale galaxy spin alignments presents a significant challenge to the standard \lcdm{}'s principle of isotropy. This work demonstrates that the \bspace{} Cosmology framework offers a natural explanation for this phenomenon via a Primordial Vorticity Field (PVF). We propose a mathematical model for the alignment fraction, show its statistical consistency with JWST data ($z=3-6$), and derive the key physical parameter, the transition redshift $z_c$. The model makes sharp, falsifiable predictions for future observations at $z>7$.
\end{abstract}

\section{Theoretical Framework}

\subsection{The Primordial Vorticity Field (PVF) Hypothesis}
\bspace{} Cosmology posits that quantum fluctuations during the Drip's formation generated a vorticity field ($\nabla \times \mathbf{v} \neq 0$) that was:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Coherent over $\sim 500$ Mpc scales, set by the inflationary horizon.
    \item Preserved by the B-Space's fundamental rigidity.
    \item Imprinted on galaxies during a top-down structure formation process.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mathematical Formulation}
The alignment fraction, $\sigma_{\text{align}}$, represents the observable portion of galaxies whose spins are coherently aligned. It derives from the survival probability of the primordial vorticity's influence against cosmic expansion. The model is given by:
\begin{equation}
    \sigma_{\text{align}}(z) = 0.5 + 0.5 \left(1 - \exp\left[-\left(\frac{1+z}{1+z_c}\right)^2\right]\right)
    \label{eq:sigma_align}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $z_c = 5.55 \pm 0.18$ is the transition redshift, a parameter measured by fitting Equation \ref{eq:sigma_align} to JWST data.
    \item \textbf{Physical Meaning:} This redshift marks the epoch where the Drip's mean density fell below a critical threshold, weakening the mechanical coupling between baryonic matter and the B-Space background. At $z \gg z_c$, alignment is highly efficient ($\sigma_{\text{align}} \to 1$), while at $z \ll z_c$, it becomes negligible, resulting in random spins ($\sigma_{\text{align}} \to 0.5$).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Master Equation Integration:} The PVF primarily affects local structure formation and does not alter the global expansion dynamics. The vorticity energy density contribution is negligible at late times, leaving the B-Space master equation for the scale factor $a(t)$ unchanged:
% --- SCIENTIFIC CORRECTION: Using the final Master Equation ---
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\ddot{a}}{a} = -\frac{4\pi G}{3}\rho_m + \frac{8\pi G}{3}\rho_{\text{ext}} - (\Gamma_0 a^3)H + \mathcal{O}(10^{-10})
\end{equation}

\section{Predictions vs. \lcdm{}}
The PVF model offers distinct, testable predictions that diverge sharply from the standard cosmological model.

    \begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Feature} & \textbf{B-Space PVF} & \textbf{\lcdm{} Expectation} \\ \midrule
    Alignment Fraction ($z=3$) & $\approx 66\%$ (Observed) & $50\%$ (Isotropic) \\
    Redshift Trend & Strong increase with $z$ & No redshift dependence \\
    Spatial Coherence & $\sim 500$ Mpc correlation length & No large-scale correlation \\
    $z=8$ Galaxies & $\approx 89\%$ alignment predicted & $50\%$ \\ \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{Observational Tests}

\subsection{JWST Validation ($z=3-6$)}
The model was tested against public JWST alignment data. By performing a fit of Equation \ref{eq:sigma_align} to the four data points from $z=3$ to $z=6$, we measure the transition redshift $z_c$. The resulting model provides an excellent fit to the observations, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:main_plot} and Table \ref{tab:results}.

    4.0 & 0.74 & 0.721 & +0.019 \\
    5.0 & 0.78 & 0.784 & -0.004 \\
    6.0 & 0.81 & 0.840 & -0.030 \\ \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Future Falsification Tests}
The calibrated model makes several strong, falsifiable predictions.

    \captionof{table}{Key Falsification Tests}
    \begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Test} & \textbf{Prediction} & \textbf{Falsification Condition} \\ \midrule
    JWST $z>7$ Spins & $\sigma(z=8) = 89\%$, $\sigma(z=10) = 95\%$ & $\sigma(z=8) < 85\%$ \\
    Euclid 3D Correlations & Spin coherence at $\sim 500$ Mpc & No detectable correlation \\
    CMB-S4 B-modes & Excess power at low multipoles ($\ell < 20$) & No B-mode excess \\ \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{Statistical Significance}
The goodness-of-fit for the model was evaluated using the Chi-Squared ($\chi^2$) test.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Parameter Measurement:} The single model parameter, $z_c$, was measured directly from the JWST $z=3-6$ data.
        \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Measured Parameter]
# From scipy.optimize.curve_fit
z_c = 5.55 +/- 0.18
        \end{lstlisting}
    \item \textbf{Goodness-of-Fit:}
        \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Chi-Squared Test Results]
Chi-Squared (X^2): 0.631
Degrees of Freedom (dof): 3
Reduced Chi-Squared (X^2/dof): 0.210
        \end{lstlisting}
    A Reduced $\chi^2$ value of $0.210$ indicates that the model is statistically sound and provides an excellent fit to the data. It may also suggest that the published observational errors are slightly overestimated.
\end{itemize}

\section{Implications for B-Space}
The success of the PVF model has several profound implications for the B-Space framework.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Quantum-to-Classical Transition:} The PVF provides a direct bridge between quantum fluctuations during inflation and the observable, classical alignment of galaxies today.
    \item \textbf{No Fine-Tuning:} The measured value of $z_c=5.55$ naturally aligns with the peak era of globular cluster formation and early galaxy assembly, suggesting a deep physical connection rather than a fine-tuned coincidence.
    \item \textbf{Energy Conservation:} The energy density of the vorticity field is predicted to decay as $a^{-4}$, making it dynamically important only at very early times and negligible today, thus preserving the late-time energy budget of the model.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}
The Primordial Vorticity Field (PVF) model, native to the B-Space Cosmology framework, successfully explains the magnitude, redshift evolution, and large-scale coherence of JWST's observed galaxy spin alignments. The model is statistically robust, requires no ad hoc assumptions, and makes a series of sharp, testable predictions for upcoming surveys at $z>7$. Future data will decisively confirm or falsify this proposed mechanism.
